## InviteMe

InviteMe is a single page application that uses React, Redux, React-Router, Bootstrap, and Firebase.

The goal of this project was to create an application for my family that allowed them to check for invites within our social circle. There was a need for this application because we would often get to the day of the event and hear, "You never invited me!"

Well, with InviteMe... There are no more excuses. We're happy with that.

The live version that goes with this project can be found here:
